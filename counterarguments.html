            <h2>Arguments Against Video Games</h2>
            <p>Even though video games have been proven to benefit the development of cognitive skills there are still many peole who oppose them. It is not uncommon to hear the negative effects 
                of gaming, regardless of their validity. While some of the arguments are valid, they are often simply products of a poor home-environment or teachings. Here, we will analyze a few 
                of the more common complaints against video games. 
            </p>
            <h3>"Video Games Cause Violence"</h3>
            <p>It is not uncommon to hear people claim "video games cause violence!" Especially in today's media, many people target video games as the 
                cause of many different ailments of society. The recent surge in shootings across the United States has appeared many times as evidence of this. 
                Numerous organizations are actively working to prove that video games cause violence. Despite the vast number of violent video 
                games, there is yet to be definitive proof that video games have any true effect on violence. Those reports that attempt to prove this claim often 
                neglect to acknowledge pre-existing conditions. Even if violent video games result in violent children, this can be easily prevented by following the 
                age recommendations and ESRB ratings. 
            </p>
            <h3>"Video Games Decrease Sociability"</h3>
            <p>Very similar to the claims that video games increase violent tendencies, many believe that the technology negatively impacts
                the socia   bility of users. Most of those who believe this claim have not tried to learn to use technology themselves. Contrarily, 
                video games are an outstanding way to meet and connect with people across the globe. Many games have become multiplayer, some even 
                requiring the gamer to work with friends in order to survive. Those who choose to play single-player games also choose to do so because 
                it is their preference. Many of those who play games alone are the same ones who would have preferred to read alone 50 years ago. Some 
                people prefer seclusion, video games just offer a new outlet for these people. Video games increase sociability in those who are looking 
                for social games but not decreasing how social these users are. 
            </p> 
            <h3>"Video Games Encourage Unhealthy Habits"</h3>
            <p>This is an argument most commonly used by those who believe the majority of gamers do not meet the appropriate health expectations: healthy dietary practices, 
                plenty of exercise and sunlight, etc. Yet this is no truer than claiming knitting encourages unhealthy habits. Video games can definitely 
                have poor effects on the health of an individual but only if that individual already has those unhealthy habits. Video games are not intended to 
                become the sole aspect of any person's life. They are intended instead to be enjoyed in moderation. If the user of technology abuses the scree-time 
                they experience, it is not the video games fault, but instead the user themselves. Everybody should be taught the practice of maintaining their health 
                at a young age. Those who choose to neglect their own health in favor of other activities cannot place the blame on video games nor the industry itself.
