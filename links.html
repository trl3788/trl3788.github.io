            <p>
                Hello! My name is Theory Ledbetter (center). I am an undergraduate student currently attending Rochester Institute of Technology. I am working toward my BS in Game Design and Development. 
                I plan to eventually be a programmer for a larger entertainment company. I have always enjoyed computers and the slow, careful analysis of working through lines of code. 
                Aside from technology, I am an avid musician (primarily a brass player) and a fan of soccer.
