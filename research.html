            <h2>Research on Effects</h2>
            <p>The benefits of video games are not exclusively limited to educational games either. Action games, such as <i>Halo</i> or <i>Call of Duty</i>, are very often credited for aiding 
                in the development of rapid decision-making skills or improving levels of perception. Survival games improve planning skills and the 
                ability to prioritize. Or racing games, which improve visuiospatial skills of users and decrease reaction times. Even beyond skill acquisition 
                and development, video games can help improve the ability of individuals to focus on difficult tasks for extended periods of time. 
                There are many people who have been diagnosed by ADD or ADHD that benefit from using video games to train themselves to focus. By working

            <p>It is unarguable that every child needs some source of knowledge and guidance during their early stages of development. The first five years of 
                a child’s life is the period in which executive skills develop at the fastest rate. Parents are indisputably the best 
                source of guidance for children, but many parents also lead busy lives working to provide for their children. 
                As a result, many children end up in daycares or watched by babysitters. The US Department of Education states that around 60 percent of 
                the 24 million children age 5 and under residing in the United States in 2014 were taken care of through some type of 
                nonparental care arrangement. Some of these arrangements are standard daycares or pre-kindergarten programs 
                while others are relative or nonrelative care. Nearly all parents still try their best to guide their children through 
                the early years and beyond, but some do not have the ability to devote enough time to their child, so some things go untaught or underdeveloped. 
                Educational video games and programs will never replace a parent in a child’s life, but they can help develop upon the structure they 
                already have. All parents, even stay-at-home parents, can benefit from using developmental tools to help teach or expand their child’s 
                knowledge.</p>

            <p>The video game industry is already one of the most far-reaching industries in the rising generations. Nearly all children, teenagers, 
                and young adults across America have almost definitely played video games at some point in their lives. As of 2011, 91% of 
                children between ages 2 and 17 played video games. With an industry reaching such an astoundingly large audience that is 
                expected to grow, it only makes sense that people would construct video games for a developmental purpose. Even in the post-critical 
                stage, gaming has beneficial effects for the individual. Researchers have found that even a game not designed 
                for cognitive development influenced those who played it. They concluded that the spatial skills improvements derived from 
                playing a shooter such as <i>Halo</i> or <i>Grand Theft Auto IV</i> were  comparable to the effects of formal courses aimed at enhancing these 
                same skills. While it would generally be discouraged to introduce a young child to a violent game such as <i>Halo</i>, the study 
                shows that there are still cognitive benefits from video games even well past early-development. Studies are also using video games, 
                such as <i>Space Fortress</i>, as a method to learn more about skill acquisition itself as games are an effective method of learning or developing 
                skills. Some studies even go as far as to create their own systems and games for the sake of research. Despite its already 
                colossal size in the modern world, the gaming industry is continuing to grow. As it continues to develop and advance, more opportunities 
                to learn are opened to the already vast number that play video games.
