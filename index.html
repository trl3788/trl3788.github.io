                are exposed to the messages spread by the video game industry daily, whether through advertisements or live-streamers or 
                the products themselves. Younger audiences, particularly those in early childhood development, are the most exposed to the 
                messages of this industry. To reach this audience, many companies have chosen to focus entirely on cognitive development 
                games for young children. Many companies are devoted solely to creating products that focus on establishing and developing 
                the minds of the young. However, the youth are not the only ones who the technology. Most young adults and even many adults 
                play games. Video games are tools that can be used for development by individuals of all ages. <br><br>
